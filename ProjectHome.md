A simple 2d fighting game written in JAVA. Two players control a character each in a versus game.

### Compiling and Running ###
Currently the game only works running from eclipse, although it should also be possible to compress it to a JAR file yourself. You will not be able to run the game without animation files generated by the rest of the project. Currently these are not on the repository, as they are copyright and not open-sourced. I am currently looking at hosting example animations in some way, and will update this site when they are available.

### Menu Screen ###
From the main menu, the options are to start a fight, or to quit. Highlight an option with the up/down arrows, and select an option using enter.

### In-Game ###
In a fight, currently the different players have different implementations of characters.
  * Player 1 (left-side)controls movement with the up, down, left and right arrows, and the spacebar.
  * Player 2 (Right-side) controls movement with the up, down, left and right number-pad arrows, as well as number pad insert.
